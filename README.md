Week 3 experiment roster:
* Filling in mean age using title: Kaelan
  - Haven't been able to change the ages yet, which is frustrating me. Titles are all separated though, which improved the validation set score but didn't change the score in the submission.
* Try various sklearn models: Tania
* Try lightgbm: Mitch
* Try NN: Max
